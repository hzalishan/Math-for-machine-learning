# Measure of Central Tendency

## Introduction

This lecture covers the **measures of central tendency**: **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.

---

## Mean

The mean (average) summarizes data by its center.

- **Population Mean (\(\mu\)):**
    $$
    \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}
    $$
    where \(x_i\) are population values, \(N\) is population size.

- **Sample Mean (\(\bar{x}\)):**
    $$
    \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
    $$
    where \(n\) is sample size.

**Example:**  
For ages \(1, 3, 4, 5\):
$$
\mu = \frac{1 + 3 + 4 + 5}{4} = 3.25
$$

**Outliers:**  
Adding \(100\) to the data:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 100}{5} = 22.6
$$
The mean increases sharply, showing sensitivity to outliers.

## Median

The **median** is the middle value in a sorted dataset.

- For \(1, 3, 4, 5, 100\) (odd count):  
    Median = 4

- For \(1, 3, 4, 5, 100, 200\) (even count):  
    Median = \(\frac{4 + 5}{2} = 4.5\)

Median is less affected by outliers.

---

## Mode

The **mode** is the most frequent value.

Example: \(4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 100\)  
Frequencies:  
- 4 appears 3 times (mode = 4)

Mode is useful for categorical data and is resistant to outliers.

---

## Summary

- **Mean:** Arithmetic average, sensitive to outliers  
- **Median:** Middle value, robust against outliers  
- **Mode:** Most frequent value, good for categorical data

---

## Conclusion

Understanding mean, median, and mode is essential in statistics and will be used in future topics like dispersion.
