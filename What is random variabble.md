# What are Random Variables

## Introduction

Random variables are essential in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis. They are typically denoted by capital letters like **X** and represent outcomes from random processes or experiments.

For example, in the equation **y = 5x + 2**, **x** can take different values, making it a random variable.

A random variable is a function that assigns values based on the outcome of an experiment.

### Example: Tossing a Coin

Let **X** be the random variable for tossing a coin. The outcomes are heads or tails, which we can assign values (e.g., heads = 0, tails = 1).

---

### Example: Rolling a Dice

When rolling a fair dice, **X** can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. These are discrete outcomes from a random process.

## Types of Random Variables

- **Discrete Random Variables:** Take countable values (e.g., coin toss, dice roll).
- **Continuous Random Variables:** Take any value within a range (e.g., rainfall amount, height).

### Discrete Random Variables

Examples include coin tosses and dice rolls, where outcomes are distinct and countable.

---

### Continuous Random Variables

Examples include measuring rainfall or height, where values can be any number within a range, including fractions and decimals.

## Summary

A random variable assigns values based on outcomes of random experiments. Discrete random variables yield countable values, while continuous random variables can take any value within a range.

Next, we will discuss probability distributions for these types of random variables.

## Key Points

- Random variables assign values from random processes.
- Two types: discrete (countable outcomes) and continuous (any value in a range).
- Examples: coin toss, dice roll (discrete); rainfall, height (continuous).
