# What Are Variables?

## Introduction

In statistics, a **variable** is a characteristic that can take different values. Variables are central to statistical analysis because they represent the data we study.

> **Definition:**  
> A variable is a property that can assume different values, but only one value at a time.

**Examples:**
- **Age:** 25 or 30, but not both simultaneously.
- **Gender:** "male" or "female".
- **Height:** 175 cm or 182 cm.

A list of values (e.g., 20, 25) is not a variable, but the possible values a variable can take.

## Types of Variables

Variables are mainly classified as:

1. **Quantitative Variables**
2. **Qualitative (Categorical) Variables**

### Quantitative Variables

Quantitative variables have numerical values and are divided into:

- **Discrete:** Whole numbers only (e.g., number of children: 3).
- **Continuous:** Any value within a range, including decimals (e.g., height: 175.5 cm).

### Qualitative (Categorical) Variables

Qualitative variables represent categories, not numbers.

**Examples:**  
- Gender: male, female  
- Color: red, green, blue  
- Place: city, village

## Summary

- **Discrete quantitative:** Whole numbers (e.g., number of children).
- **Continuous quantitative:** Any value, including decimals (e.g., weight).
- **Qualitative (categorical):** Categories (e.g., gender, color).

## Key Points

- A variable can take different values, but only one at a time.
- Variables are either **quantitative** (discrete or continuous) or **qualitative** (categorical).
- Knowing these types is essential, especially for interviews in statistics and data science.
