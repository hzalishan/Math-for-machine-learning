Population vs. Sample Data
--------------------------

Introduction
------------

Before exploring measures of central tendency and dispersion, it's crucial to understand the concepts of population and sample in statistics.

### What is a Population?

A population includes all individuals or items of interest. For example, if an island has 100,000 residents, the population is all those people.

### Challenges in Collecting Population Data

Gathering data from every member of a population is often impractical due to time, cost, and accessibility constraints.

### What is a Sample?

A sample is a subset of the population, such as selecting 10,000 people from the island. Samples are used to make inferences about the population, and various sampling methods exist.

### Role of Samples in Statistics

Inferential statistics rely on sample data to draw conclusions about populations. For example, election exit polls use samples to predict outcomes.

### Statistical Notations

Population size is denoted by capital **N**, while sample size is denoted by lowercase **n**. These notations are used in formulas for means and other measures.

Summary
-------

Understanding population and sample is fundamental in statistics and prepares you for further study of statistical measures.

Key Points
----------

*   Population: entire group under study (**N**)
*   Sample: subset of the population (**n**)
*   Sampling enables analysis when studying the whole population is impractical
*   Notations **N** (population size) and **n** (sample size) are essential in statistics
