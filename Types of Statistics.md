Types of Statistics
-------------------

Introduction
------------

Statistics is broadly divided into two main types: descriptive and inferential. Understanding these is essential, especially for interviews, where you may be asked to explain their differences with examples.

Types of Statistics
-------------------

* **Descriptive Statistics**
* **Inferential Statistics**

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics involves organizing and summarizing data. Common techniques include:

* **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, Mode
* **Measures of Dispersion**: Variance, Standard Deviation

These methods help describe and summarize the main features of a dataset.

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is about drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data. It uses experiments and tests (like the Z-test) to make predictions or inferences about a larger group.

The process typically involves:

1. Collecting sample data
2. Performing experiments
3. Making inferences about the population

### Example

Suppose a college has 1000 students. You collect the heights of a few students as a sample (e.g., 180 cm, 170 cm, 162 cm, etc.).

* **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate the mean, median, or mode of the sample heights to summarize the data.
* **Inferential Statistics**: Use the sample to estimate the average height of all 1000 students.

Descriptive statistics summarizes sample data, while inferential statistics uses sample data to make conclusions about the population.

Upcoming Topics
---------------

We will further explore:

* Population vs. Sample
* Measures of central tendency
* Measures of dispersion

Conclusion
----------

Descriptive statistics summarizes data; inferential statistics draws conclusions about a population from a sample. Understanding both is key to effective data analysis.

Key Points
----------

* Two main types: descriptive and inferential statistics
* Descriptive: summarizes data (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
* Inferential: makes predictions about populations from samples
* Knowing the difference between population and sample is essential
