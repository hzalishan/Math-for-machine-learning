# Introduction to Statistics and Its Applications

Welcome to the statistics course. Here, you'll learn how statistics is used in machine learning, data science, and many other fields. Statistics helps us collect, organize, analyze, interpret, and present data to make informed decisions.

## Why Use Statistics?

We use statistics to understand data and make better decisions. For example, analyzing customer ages in online shopping helps target promotions effectively. Measures like mean and median, and understanding distributions (normal, log-normal, etc.), guide these decisions.

## Analysis and Visualization

Statistical techniques let us visualize data using histograms, probability density functions (PDFs), and cumulative density functions (CDFs). These visualizations reveal patterns and distributions, supporting decision-making.

## Real-World Example: Banking ATM Location

Suppose a bank wants to open a new ATM near an existing one. By analyzing transaction data and operational costs, the bank can decide if the new location is viable. This is statistical decision-making in action.

## Who Uses Statistics?

Statistics is used by:

- Machine learning practitioners
- Data scientists and analysts
- Business intelligence professionals
- Risk analysts
- Everyday individuals

## Example: COVID-19 Vaccine Safety

Researchers used statistics to analyze trial data and determine vaccine safety, showing its importance in public health decisions.

## Conclusion

Statistics is essential for understanding data and making informed choices in various domains. In upcoming sessions, we'll explore these concepts further.

## Key Takeaways

- Statistics involves collecting, analyzing, and presenting data.
- Its main goal is to enable informed decision-making.
- Tools like mean, median, and visualizations (histograms, PDFs, CDFs) help analyze data.
- Statistics is widely used in business, technology, and public health.
